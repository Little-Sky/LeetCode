Though I am working full-time on doing LeetCode, I am not very productive recently, say, 10 questions/day. After all, questions in LeetCode is just too boring to attract me. So I'm thinking about working on them in a funnier way, say, in a chui shui way. No more coding, just thinking and went through the discussions to check the ideas.
